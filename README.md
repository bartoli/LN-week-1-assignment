# Mastering Lightning Network - Week 1: Generating Lightning Invoice

## Overview

In this first week you will:

1. **Set up** Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning (CLN) nodes using Docker.
2. **Interact** with both Bitcoin Core and Lightning nodes on `regtest`.
3. **Fund** a Lightning node and create a BOLT11 invoice.
4. **Output** a small report file named (`out.txt`) in the **current directory** demonstrating you can fund a Lightning node and generate valid invoices.
5. **Target Locations** for the solution code for each language are given below:
   - Bash: [solution.sh](./bash/solution.sh)
   - JavaScript: [index.js](./javascript/index.js)
   - Python: [main.py](./python/main.py)
   - Rust: [main.rs](./rust/src/main.rs)

## Problem Statement

Lightning Network is a Layer 2 payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. Before a Lightning node can send or receive payments, it needs to have on-chain Bitcoin funds and create payment channels. The following exercise introduces us to the basics of setting up and funding a Lightning node. 

We will be using Docker to set up Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning nodes, after which we fund the Lightning node with `regtest` Bitcoin and generate a BOLT 11 Lightning invoice

## Solution Requirements

You need to write code in any one of `bash`, `javascript`, `python` or `rust` that will do the following:

### Setup - Docker Compose

The assignment uses Docker Compose to run both Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning nodes. The configuration is provided in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).

Services:
- **bitcoind**: Bitcoin Core node running on regtest
  - RPC port: 18443
  - RPC credentials: alice/password
- **cln** (ln-node): Core Lightning node
  - Connected to bitcoind
  - Network: regtest

To start the services:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
To stop the services:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Node Interaction - Choose ONE Language

Implement the tasks in exactly one of the language-specific directories: `bash`, `javascript`, `python`, or `rust`.

Each implementation uses helper functions located in the directories.

Your program must:

- Create a new Lightning address

- Check a mining wallet exists or create it, and generate a new address from the mining wallet
- Mine new blocks to this address until you get positive wallet balance. (use `generatetoaddress`) (observe how many blocks it took to get to a positive balance)
- Write a short comment describing why wallet balance for block rewards behaves that way.

- Fund the Lightning node from the mining wallet and confirm the transaction

- Verify Lightning wallet balance and create a Lightning invoice

### Output

Output the following invoice details to `out.txt` in the root directory. Each attribute should be on a new line:
- Payment hash
- BOLT11 invoice string
- Amount in millisatoshis
- Description
- Expiry time

Sample output file:

```

## Code Structure

Each language implementation follows a consistent pattern:

```
<language>/
  ├── helper.<ext>      # Helper functions for Bitcoin/Lightning CLI
  ├── main.<ext>        # Main implementation
  └── run-<language>.sh # Script to run the implementation
```

Helper functions abstract Docker CLI interactions:
- `bitcoin_cli(command)`: Execute bitcoin-cli commands via Docker
- `ln_cli(command)`: Execute lightning-cli commands via Docker

## Local Testing

### Prerequisites

| Language       | Prerequisite packages                  |
| -------------- |----------------------------------------|
| **Bash**       | Docker, Docker Compose, `jq`           |
| **JavaScript** | Docker, Docker Compose, Node.js ≥ 20   |
| **Python**     | Docker, Docker Compose, Python ≥ 3.9  |
| **Rust**       | Docker, Docker Compose, Rust toolchain |

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   # Follow Docker installation guide for your OS
   # https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
   ```

2. **Install Language Components**

   #### Bash
   - **Version** 4.0 or higher (usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS)
    ```bash
    # check version
    bash --version
    
    # to install jq [JSON processor to parse JSON responses]
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y jq       # Ubuntu/Debian
    brew install jq                                         # macOS
    ```

   #### JavaScript
   - **Node.js Version** 20.x or higher

   ```bash
    # check version
    node --version
    npm --version
    
    # install nvm
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
    nvm install 20
    nvm use 20
    
    # install project dependencies
    cd javascript
    npm install
    ```

   #### Python
   - **Version** 3.9 or higher
    ```bash
    # check version
    python3 --version
    pip3 --version

    # install python
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv       # Ubuntu/Debian
    brew install python@3.9                                                               # macOS

    # install required dependencies
    pip3 install requests python-bitcoinrpc
    ```

   #### Rust
   - **Version** 1.70.0 or higher
    ```bash
    # check version
    rustc --version
    cargo --version

    # installation via rustup
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh                        # Linux/macOS
    # Follow the prompts, then reload your shell.
    source $HOME/.cargo/env

    # build essentials
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev                         # Ubuntu/Debian

    # Build the project
    cd rust
    cargo build
    ```

3. **Start the nodes**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Local Testing Steps
It's a good idea to run the whole test locally to ensure your code is working properly.

- Uncomment the specific line in [run.sh](./run.sh) corresponding to your language of choice. 
- Grant execution permission to [test.sh](./test.sh), by running `chmod +x ./test.sh`.
- Execute `./test.sh`.
- The test script will run your script and verify the output. If the test script passes, you have successfully completed the challenge and are ready to submit your solution.

### Common Issues

- If docker containers not running ensure `docker-compose up -d` completed successfully
- Make sure Docker daemon is running and you have permissions using `docker ps`
- Ensure `out.txt` has exactly 5 lines in the correct order
- The autograder will run the test script on an Ubuntu 22.04 environment. Make sure your script is compatible with this environment.
- If you are unable to run the test script locally, you can submit your solution and check the results on the Github.

## Submission

- Commit all code inside the appropriate language directory and the modified `run.sh`.
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "Week 1 solution"
  ```
- Push to the main branch:
  ```
    git push origin main
  ```
- The autograder will run your script against a test script to verify the functionality.
- Check the status of the autograder on the Github Classroom portal to see if it passed successfully or failed. Once you pass the autograder with a score of 100, you have successfully completed the challenge.
- You can submit multiple times before the deadline. The latest submission before the deadline will be considered your final submission.
- You will lose access to the repository after the deadline.
